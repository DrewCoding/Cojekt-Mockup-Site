This is a barebones mock-up of the frontend side of the Cojekt interface. Cojekt is a more user-friendly version of GitHub that is currently propoietary. 
This frontend site dates to Feburary 2025, and now I have decided to show it off onto GitHub. 
This was initially the standard project page to download, get user support, and contribute to the project with many different kinds of features.
